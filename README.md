# Zombie-Game
Whack all of the zombies in the arena to survive!

Avoid being "attacked" by zombies when colliding with them, and whack the zombies into the walls to do double damage.

Game demonstrates use of 5 classes. 

Lowercase zombies.cpp contains original solution/build of the zombie game completed in CS 31 with smallberg. In this case, the entire game is contained in one cpp file.

The rest of the files, including uppercase Zombies.cpp, is a project from CS 32 in which we used Smallberg's zombie game solution and were required to add a History component to the game, as well as organize the game into header and cpp files.
